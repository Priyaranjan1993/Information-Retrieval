1. At first, I calculated the document length of each document in the corpus. I counted the number of unique words in the document and stored it against each document name.

2. I had earlier created a file for queries. The program read each query from the query file and made BM25 calculation for each query.

3. The function BM25Calculation() does many calculations. First , it calculates the number of documents which is "N". It then calculates the average document length "avdl".
	It then creates a inverted index of the unigram text file it was provided to it as the input.

4. For each query The BM25Calculation() function then creates a inverted list "qry_inverted_List" for each word in it. It then creates a map/dictionary for storing the term frequency
	for each word in the query i.e, "query_term_frequency".
	
5. For each entry in the "qry_inverted_List" , we calculate the value of "n" which is the count of the documents in which the query term appears. We then calculate "qf" which is the query term frequency.

6.	Then for each posting of each term in the  "qry_inverted_List", we calcualate "f" and "dl".

7.	Then using N,n,qf,f,dl,avdl computed above we calcualate BM25 score for each document present in the "qry_inverted_List" for each query.

8. The function BM25_Formula() calculates "k" using N,n,qf,f,dl,avdl which are inputs to the function.

9.	After finding all the BM25 scores for the query, we write the output to the file "results.txt".

10. We repeat the same process for each query provided in the "queryList.txt".
