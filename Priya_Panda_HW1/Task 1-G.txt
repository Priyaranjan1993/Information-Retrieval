URL Overlap
=============
Only 31 URLs from both DFS and BFS crawling overlap.

Quality and efficiency aspect
==============================
BFS - It takes 18.64 mins to execute crawling in case of BFS(includes some overhead)
DFS - It takes 18.20 mins to execute crawling in case of DFS

In short DFS takes a bit more time to execute than BFS if we remove the overhead from BFS.

The quality of BFS is better in comparision to DFS in terms of keyword appearance i.e solar or eclipse

Coverage
============
564 URLs match with the string "solar" or "eclipse" (both case insensitive) in case of BFS.
Only 3 URL match with the string "solar" or "eclipse" (both case insensitive) in case of DFS.

461 URLs match with the string "solar_eclipse" (case insensitive) in case of BFS.
Only 1 URL match with the string "solar_eclipse" (case insensitive) in case of DFS.
